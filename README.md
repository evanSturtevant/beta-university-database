# beta-university-database
Worked with a team to design and implement a PostgreSQL database for a mock client

This project was through the Database Management Systems course at Junaita. 
The document contains all code, diagramming, and reports done for the project as well as all past iterations of the project.
The database itself was hosted on the schools unix server, and used an HTML front end.
